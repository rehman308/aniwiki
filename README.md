# Project Overview

This is a responsive web application built with user-friendly mobile experience in mind, using the latest versions of Node.js, Express.js, React (with Vite), and Material-UI (MUI). The application allows users to manage a catalog of animals, fishes, and insects by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing details about each item. The backend is powered by a RESTful API with data stored in MongoDB.
